Problem Statement

THE W.H.O GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE STUDY ESTIMATES
THAT MENTAL AND ADDICTIVE DISORDERS ARE AMONG THE
MOST BURDENSOME IN THE WORLD AND THEIR BURDEN WILL
INCREASE OVER NEXT DECADES. HOWEVER, THESE ESTIMATES
AND PROJECTIONS ARE BASED LARGELY ON LITERATURE
REVIEWS AND LIMITED AND ISOLATED STUDIES RATHER THAN
ON CROSS-NATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEYS. HEALTHCARE
ISN’T JUST HOW YOU SEE YOURSELF PHYSICALLY, BUT ALSO
HOW WELL YOU ARE IN YOUR MENTAL STATE. A LOT OF
PEOPLE, WHO AREN’T DOING WELL MENTALLY TEND TO FORM
A PATTERN OF ACTIONS WITH THEIR DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES,
FIRST, ONE BEING THEIR CHOICE OF WORDS, GOOGLE
SEARCHES, SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITIES ETC.

CREATE AN APPLICATION/WEBSITE FOR THE FOLLOWING FEATURES-

1: OWN DATA AND NOTIFY THEM OF THEIR MENTAL WELL-
BEING. PROVIDE ANALYSIS OF SUBSEQUENT BEHAVIOR.

2: TRACK DOWN THE USER’S MENTAL STATE USING THEIR
OWN DATA AND NOTIFY THEM OF THEIR MENTAL WELL-
BEING. PROVIDE ANALYSIS OF SUBSEQUENT BEHAVIOR.

3: SUGGEST ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AND
KEEP A TRACK OF THE COMPLETION OF THOSE ACTIVITIES.
ENCOURAGING WORDS/ REWARDS TO THE USERS ON
ACHIEVING A PARTICULAR MILESTONE ALSO INFLUENCES
THEM POSITIVELY.

4: A PROVISION FOR THE USER TO JOIN VARIOUS
COMMUNITIES/SUPPORT GROUPS TO CHAT AND SHARE
THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH LIKE MINDED PEOPLE.

5: SUGGEST A THERAPIST BASED ON THEIR EXPERTISE IN THE
FIELD.
