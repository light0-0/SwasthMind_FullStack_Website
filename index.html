                <h3>Mental Health Problems Affect Everyone</h3>
                <br>
                <h5>Myth: Children don't experience mental health problems.</h5>
                <article>Fact: Even very young children may show early warning signs of mental health concerns. These
                    mental
                    health problems are often clinically diagnosable, and can be a product of the interaction of
                    biological, psychological, and social factors.</article>
                <br>
                <article>Half of all mental health disorders show first signs before a person turns 14 years old, and
                    three-quarters of mental health disorders begin before age 24.</article>
                <br>
                <article>Unfortunately, only half of children and adolescents with diagnosable mental health problems
                    receive
                    the treatment they need. Early mental health support can help a child before problems interfere with
                    other developmental needs.</article>
                <hr>

                <h5>Myth: People with mental health problems are violent and unpredictable.</h5>
                <article>Fact: The vast majority of people with mental health problems are no more likely to be violent
                    than anyone else. Most people with mental illness are not violent and only 3% to 5% of violent acts
                    can
                    be attributed to individuals living with a serious mental illness. In fact, peole with severe
                    mental illnesses are over 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime than the general
                    population. You probably know someone with a mental health problem and don't even realize it,
                    because many people with mental health problems are highly active and productive members of our
                    communities.</article>
                <hr>
                <h5>Myth: People with mental health needs, even those who are managing their mental illness, cannot
                    tolerate the stress of holding down a job.</h5>
                <article>Fact: People with mental health problems are just as productive as other employees. Employers
                    who hire people with mental health problems report good attendance and punctuality as well as
                    motivation, good work, and job tenure on par with or greater than other employees.

                <article>It has been consistently reported that in the UK, the LGBTQ+ community may experience increased
                    levels of common mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. According to a
                    research project conducted by Youth Chances, 52% of LGBTQ people reported self-harming, compared to
                    35% of heterosexual non-trans young people. Furthermore, 44% of the LGBTQ people reported
                    suicidal thoughts, compared to 26% of heterosexual non-trans respondents. In a study by
                    Stonewall, it was also found that 13% of LGBT people aged 18-24 attempted to take their own life in
                    the past year.

                    day over the last year, compared to 10% of the general population. This also increases with age,

                <h3>What Causes Grief?</h3>
                <article>While it is not clear exactly what causes prolonged or complicated grief, the cause of normal
                    grief can most commonly be attributed to the death of a loved one. According to the University of
                    Rochester, grief can also be caused by the following:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="text-dark">Loss of a job</li>
                        <li class="text-dark">Loss of a beloved pet</li>
                        <li class="text-dark">Loss of a friendship</li>
                        <li class="text-dark">Loss of a personal dream</li>
                        <li class="text-dark">Loss of a romantic relationship</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                    that
                    may indicate that someone is having a problem dealing with grief. A person having difficulty with

                <h3>Emotional Symptoms of Grieving</h3>
                <article>A person who is dealing with grief will most likely display some of the emotional symptoms
                    associated with grieving. The Mayo Clinic lists the emotional symptoms found with prolonged, or
                    complicated, grief. These can include:</article>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-dark">Increased irritability</li>
                    <li class="text-dark">Numbness</li>
                    <li class="text-dark">Bitterness</li>
                    <li class="text-dark">Detachment</li>
                    <li class="text-dark">Preoccupation with loss</li>
                    <li class="text-dark">Inability to show or experience joy</li>
                </ul>
                <article>
                    While these emotional symptoms are normal in the days and weeks after a traumatic event, they can be
                    indicators of a more serious disorder if they do not fade over time.</article>
